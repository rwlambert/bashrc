'''A module which implements a unix-like "tail" of a file.
A callback is made for every new line found in the file.  Options
specify whether the existing contents of the file should be read
or ignored.

@author Sean Reifschneider <jafo@tummy.com>
@version $Revision: 1.52 $

Released under the GPLv2 or any later version.

If a file is emptied or removed, the tail will continue reading lines
which are written in the new place.

Simple example:

	import tail

	def callback(line):
		print 'Line: "%s"' % string.rstrip(line)

	tail.tail('/var/log/all', callback).mainloop()

		@param callback Function which takes one argument, called with each
