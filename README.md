# Rob's scripts and .bashrc

Rob keeps having to copy his .bashrc everywhere, so he made a git repo out of it, and will clone it around for when/if modifications are needed.

Usage:

./run/deploy.sh : rsync any updates to the contents of $HOME

./run/collect.sh : rsync any updates from the local system into this package
